## Graphite

Graphite is a decentralized and encrypted alternative to Google's G-Suite, built on [Blockstack](http://blockstack.org). The app never stores your identity or any of your data. You own your files, you choose what to share.

Check it out at http://app.graphitedocs.com

Graphite is open source and available for contributions. It is also available to simple run locally. One of the exciting things about this app is you can run it (alongside Blockstack) without ever going to the Graphite URL.

## Install

Graphite is open source and welcomes new issues, feature requests, and contributions.

Steps to install:

1) Clone the repo.
2) Run 'npm install'
3) Run 'npm run start' Note: the initial build time might take a couple minutes, but once it's running, it should be very quick.
4) Have fun!

## Motivation

This project stemmed from the increasing control companies place on user data. At any given moment, Google can remove access to every single one of the documents you write and store with them. That's unacceptable.

Additionally, government censorship, which has always been around, seems to be growing more prevalent.

Graphite sets out to change that, and this was only possible because of the work done by Blockstack.
